**That’s it — simple and useful Git for real work.**

## 📎 Extra: What's the Difference Between `git fetch` and `git pull`?

- `git fetch`: Downloads updates from the remote, but does **not** change your current files or branches. You can review changes before applying them.
- `git pull`: Does **both** a `fetch` and a `merge`. It updates your current branch with any changes from the remote branch.

### 📥 Pull Remote Changes and Merge
```bash
git pull
```
